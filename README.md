# qsm-chicago
This repo is intended to demonstrate the basics of conducting economics research with quantitative spatial models. I derive and calibrate a simple quantitative spatial model of Chicago and conduct two counterfactual exercises. I then repeat this process for a richer model and compare the results.

This repo is a work in progress. Extensive documentation is available [here](docs.pdf).

This repo is intended for educational purposes and should be employed with caution. Comments and corrections are welcome and encouraged.
