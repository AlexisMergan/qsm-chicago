# qsm-chicago
This repo is intended to demonstrate the basics of conducting economics research with quantitative spatial models. I calibrate a simple quantitative spatial model of Chicago. I conduct some counterfactual exercises.

Extensive documentation is available [here](docs.pdf).

To do:
- [ ] QSM A counterfactual exercises
- [ ] QSM A exposition
- [ ] Initialize expanded QSM
- [ ] Create .py file for common cleaning across 2 QSM versions
